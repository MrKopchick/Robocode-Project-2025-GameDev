financial literacy game

The player controls a character who is used to living recklessly: he spends all his money on unnecessary things, constantly takes out loans, and hopes that his problems will resolve themselves. As a result, he ends up in a financial crisis—burdened with debt, living in terrible conditions, without personal transportation, and with no prospects.

But one day, fate gives him an unexpected gift—a large inheritance. This is a chance to start a new life! However, will he be able to manage this money wisely?

The player will have to make difficult financial and moral decisions that will affect the story’s progression. The choice is yours: pay off debts, invest, start your own business, or squander everything again and sink even deeper into trouble.

The game has multiple endings, determined by your decisions. In the end, your financial summary will be displayed, motivating you to replay the game and make different choices.
